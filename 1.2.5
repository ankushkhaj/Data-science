1.What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
with rainy_days as (select t.duration,w.events from trips t join weather w on t.zip_code=w.zip 
					and w.events='Rain' order by t.duration desc)
					
select distinct * from (select duration,events,dense_rank() over (order by duration desc) as rank1 
								   from rainy_days) A where rank1<=3
					
          
2. Which station is full most often?
select name from stations A inner join(select station_id, count(bikes_available)  from status where bikes_available=0 
group by station_id order by count(bikes_available) desc 
limit 1) B ON A.station_id=B.station_id

3.Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that 
station but ordered by dock count.
SELECT
start_station,
dockcount,
COUNT(*)
FROM trips
JOIN stations
ON stations.name=trips.start_station
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 DESC

4.(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
with A as (SELECT t.trip_id,t.duration,date(t.start_date) as start_date,w.events
from trips t inner join  weather w on date(t.start_date)=date(w.date)
WHERE events = 'Rain' order by duration desc)
select A.start_date,max(A.duration) as longest_trip from A  
group by A.start_date
limit 1
