Problem:
How to make sure that more patients show up when they have doctor appointment.We know that sometimes patient do not remember that 
they have doctor appointment and that is the reason they forget to showup.There should be some way of reminding the patient in order 
to keep them updated about the appointment.

Potential Solution:
We hypothize that sending SMS Reminders might be  a good way of reminding the patients about the upcoming doctor appointment
By this way,we can expect increase  of patient showing up for the appointment over time.


Methods:
The study will consist of two randomized samples in the population of the patients.The initial analysis will involve 5% of patients 
getting the SMS reminders as compared to other sample which are not getting any reminders.This initial analysis will be for 3 months 
and the progress will be measured if there is any change in increase of  patients showing up after the SMS reminders.If there is no 
impact , then this study will be cancelled without any extension.If there is an increase , the analysis will be extended to 3 more months
for 10% patients and again, progress will be measured.Now, at the end of study period,both the samples will be compared based on number of 
patients showing up to the appointment and if there is a significant difference between the result of both the samples.
   If there is a significant increase in  patients showing up to appointments after SMS Reminders then this study will be considered a
success and then,this method will be used to rest of the population and the results will be reviewed periodically.
