    "The study will consist of two randomized samples in the population of the patients.The initial analysis will involve 5% of patients getting the SMS reminders as compared to other sample which are not getting any reminders.This initial analysis will be for 3 months and the progress will be measured if there is any change in increase of  patients showing up after the SMS reminders.If there is no impact , then this study will be cancelled without any extension.If there is an increase , the analysis will be extended to 3 more months for 10% patients and again, progress will be measured.Now, at the end of study period,both the samples will be compared based on number of patients showing up to the appointment and if there is a significant difference between the result of both the samples.\n",
    "   If there is a significant increase in  patients showing up to appointments after SMS Reminders then this study will be considered a success and then,this method will be used to rest of the population and the results will be reviewed periodically.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   We can prove this hypothesis by using t-test using 2 samples of population- one sample test population and other one is the original sample population.If the t- value is not that significant , then two populations samples are similar, that means there was no change after the SMS Reminder test was done .But if t-value is signficant , then two samples are signficantly different from each other ,which will conclude that SMS reminders did have an impact on the sample population.Now, if p value in t-test is more than 0.05% then , this test can be rejected but if t-test <0.05% then only, this test can used to be analyse the sample population."
