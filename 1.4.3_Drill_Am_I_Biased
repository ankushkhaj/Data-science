1.You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
Ans:Since bathing suit is a seasonal product, sending emails in May may result into more sales because of its proximity to summer.
I would expect more sales in May than in February irrespective of the version of the emails.I would also suggest to add some coupons or any offers included in the subject of email.This might help to increase sales irrespective of month such as Feb or May

2.You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
Ans.The population that is visiting the clinic has higher rate of anxiety ,which shows that the sample  from general population is not random.Its a specific sample of population.So , experiment looks to be biased.It would be great if we can have random people visting the clinic and then check the results.

3.You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
Ans.Since its the first week  for the new billboard campaign, its expected to have more website visits.The real test would be check the results after few weeks if the website visits increase or decrease rapidly.In order to increase the website subscription or number of visits,I would encourage promotion of the website through social media.

4.You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
Ans.The loyalty program might not show increase in visits since its a the first week and its too early to draw conclusions.The suggestion would be to include monthly reward points to encourage more subscriptions and if you refer someone for sunscription, you will get more points from which you buy something from the website.
