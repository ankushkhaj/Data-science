Will new uniforms help a gym's business?

The problem
Gym business is not doing so great.Gym owners are thinking for new initiatives in order  to get more profits for their business

The potential solution
Introducing new uniform is a new initiative to improve gym business.This may bring something new and exciting to the staff and eventually help to bring new customers.Currently there is no dress code for the gym and its hard to differentiate between staff and customers.Customers feel that by having a uniform, they will feel more satisfied about the quality of service.

The method of testing the solution
Initially a new uniform will be introduced for one branch and other brach in the same area will not have this change.Then we will monitor the renewal and joining of customers for both the branch for 3 months.If profits are significant that is more than 10% then this initiative will be continued and introduced to new branch one by one.If there is no profit or if there is some loss, then this new change will be stopped for all the branch.
